title: "Non-planar robotic assisted embedded bioprinting"
excerpt: "**Why:** Fiber orientation plays a key role in native tissue function. Current additive manufacturing schemes utilize planar layer-by-layer slicing and fabrication and fail to recapitulate the non-planar fiber orientation in native tissue. <br/> **What and How:** I developed a robotic-assisted additive manufacturing platform to perform nonplanar embedded AM.

For this platform design, I integrated compatible hardware to a UR5e manipulator and devised the software architecture. I also programmed the extrusion motor for simultaneous extrusion with robot end effector movements in Arduino IDE and bridged that to root control via Python and ROS. I have also programmed the nonplanar trajectories in Matlab and Python and successfully 3D printed nonplanar geometries. A curved tube example is demonstrated below.  <br/>
