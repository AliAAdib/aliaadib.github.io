 I am a mechanical engineer with interdisciplinary expertise in additive manufacturing (3D Printing), mechatronics hardware and software development, robotics and control, material science, and process optimization. I got my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from The Ohio State University and I am currently a post-doctoral scholar at Carnegie Mellon University. I am leading multiple projects at the Biomedical Engineering Dept. and in collaboration with the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at CMU at the confluence of additive manufacturing, robotics, and material science, developing AM platforms and solutions for the fabrication of biological tissue engineering scaffolds.

A Brief Overview of My Research Experience
======
My Ph.D. research at [HRL](https://mae.osu.edu/hrl) was at the confluence of additive manufacturing (AM), robotics and control, and tissue engineering to develop robotics and material solutions for minimally invasive fabrication of 3D tissues inside the human body. To this aim, I developed a biocompatible polymeric formulation consisting of a biopolymer and rheological modifier polymers and tuend its formulation to be 3D printable via Extrusion-Based Direct-Write AM at physiological conditions. I also designed and implemented a pressure feedback control scheme to control flow rate in direct write AM, to improve 3D print fidelity and eliminate print defects caused by lack or excess material deposition at the start and stop of flow. We do not want any excess or lack of material deposition when printing inside a human! In addition, I contributed to the design and build of the first-ever 9-DOF endoscopic AM robot to perform intracorporeal (inside the body) AM in a minimally invasive manner.

Future Career Aspiration
======
I would like to take the next big step in my career and transition into the industry to apply my academic knowledge as a Senior Mechanical Engineer to real-world problems.
