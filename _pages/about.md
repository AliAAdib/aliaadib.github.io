This is Ali and I am a mechanical engineer with interdisciplinary expertise in additive manufacturing, mechatronics hardware and software development, dynamics and control, material science, process optimization, and robotics. I got my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from The Ohio State University and I am currently a post-doctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University. 

A Brief Overview of Past Research and Future Career Directions
